## Project Structure

- `/backend`: Includes the Node.js backend code. 


## Getting Started 

### Installation and Deployment

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    ```bash   
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the MySQL database:
   Create a MySQL database and update the db-config.js file in the backend folder with your database credentials.


4. Start the development servers:
    ```bash

    cd ../backend
    node server
    ```
